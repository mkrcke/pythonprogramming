# Before Submission, always check


1. Make sure everything runs as expected. First, **restart the kernel** (in the menubar) and then **run all cells** (in the menubar)
2. Make sure that no assertions fail or exceptions occur, otherwise points will be subtracted.
3. After you submit the notebook more tests will be run on your code. The fact that no assertions fail on your computer localy does not guarantee that completed the exercise correctly.
4. Please submit only the `*.ipynb` file.
5. Make sure you fill in any place that says `YOUR CODE HERE` or \"YOUR ANSWER HERE\". Edit only between `YOUR CODE HERE` and `END YOUR CODE`.
6. Make sure to use Python 3, not Python 2.
